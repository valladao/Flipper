Project: a Twitter clone using Redis and Express
The JavaScript Full-Stack Bootcamp
Flavio Copes

In this module we’re going to create a sample application using Node.js, Express, and Redis as the database.

The pages of our app will be generated server-side, with vanilla JavaScript (no framework) on the client side.

The application, called Flipper, will be a bare-bones clone of Twitter, a popular social network that lets users post messages that other users can see, they can follow and they can be followed.

We’re going to implement the following:

    Signing up to Flipper, creating an account
    Posting messages
    We can follow people, and we can have people follow us
    We can see messages of people we follow
